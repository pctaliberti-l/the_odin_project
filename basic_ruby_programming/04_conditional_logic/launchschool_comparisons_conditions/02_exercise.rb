# Write a method that takes a string as argument. 
# The method should return a new, all-caps version of the string, 
# only if the string is longer than 10 characters. 
# Example: change "hello world" to "HELLO WORLD". (Hint: Ruby's String class has a few methods that would be helpful. Check the Ruby Docs!)
